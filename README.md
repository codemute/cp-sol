# Competitive Programming - Solutions

We know that there are lots of contests happening every month, probably every
week on various sites like Codeforces, CodeChef, Hackerrank, Hackerearth, etc.
Phew! There are lot of sites. We know sometimes you just need the solution to
some particular problem you had previously solved, or maybe you want to have a
quick look at the solution just to remind yourselves how you had solved it.

Well, this repository will be helpful to you then. Here are the solutions to 
every problem we solved across different sites so you can have a look at them.
Beware that all of these solutions are **only updated after the contest has**
**ended**. We too disgust the idea of plagiarism.

If you find any mistakes in the solution, make sure to [create an issue][issue].
Also, If you find this repository useful make sure to give it a star. :star:
